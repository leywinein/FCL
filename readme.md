### Website FAQ

Can I use the fun challenge list template that WE stole from electro?

- I mean, sure. head over to [releases](https://github.com/ElectroFlameOfficial/gdshittylist/releases) and choose the latest release. just make sure you give credit somewhere and make sure you state that you're not affiliated with the shitty list.

The website isn't loading, who do I ask?

- When the website goes down, feel free to ping a list admin or owner to go in and fix it. We wont be mad!!

### List FAQ

How long will my record take to get accepted?

- Records take us roughly a week at most. When a record takes more that a week to be added to the list, ask why in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/NwJBKt5VGG)

What do New record, update record, and fix record mean?

- new record is when you're submitting a record for a level for the first time, update record is when you have a record on a level but you got a new best and it needs to be updated, fix record is when there is an issue with one of your records that needs to be fixed.

What's an easy way to prove I don't hack?

- Show 2-5 seconds at the end of the previous attempt and the death of that attempt. This is the easiest way for us to verify you aren't hacking/nocliping. However having click, fps counter or hand cam will help out a lot too

It's been like more than a week and my record still hasn't been added, what do i do?

- You can ask us in [#list-support](https://discord.gg/hMWejbcuHJ) , it was probably an accidentally deleted record(yes it happens), accidentally deleting the form, your name was misspelled or you were rejected for cheating

When will \_\_\_ be added to the list?

- With the way our current system works, the staff and reliables play the levels, if the level gets enough positive opinions from us, it then goes into voting, where it is voted on if it will be added

Can i submit Multiple levels on 1 video?

- Yes
